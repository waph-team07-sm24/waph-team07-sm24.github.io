            <p>From a young age, I was fascinated by the world of technology and computers. It was around 8th grade when I first dabbled in programming, and I instantly fell in love with it. The idea of being able to create something from scratch using just lines of code was incredibly exciting to me.</p>

            <p>I was first introduced to programming in 5th grade when I joined my school's robotics team and I knew that it was my passion. I continued to work on small personal projects throughout highschool while also creating and leading our school's robotics team. I fell in love with the challenge and problem solving accociated with programming. </p>
