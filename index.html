            <p>From a young age, I was fascinated by the world of technology and computers. It was around 8th grade when I first dabbled in programming, and I instantly fell in love with it. The idea of being able to create something from scratch using just lines of code was incredibly exciting to me.</p>

            <p>I got my start in programming from my High School Engineering teacher. At the time I knew I wanted to go into the sciences, however something about tech really stood out to me. I continued my studies through personal projects connecting my interests in sports and games, cementing my choice to study the field in college. I love the creativity you can bring to the table to solve problems using tech, especially when it all comes together in one grand system.</p>
